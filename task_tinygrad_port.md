Port tinygrad: ~/tinygrad/ to OCaml. Where reasonable, minimize how much of the frontend niceties are ported if functionality is not significantly reduced. Port a CPU C backend and the CUDA and Metal MSL backends using the `cudajit` ~/ocaml-cudajit/ and `metal` ~/ocaml-metal/ packages, do not port the other lower-level backends. Balance faithfulness to the tinygrad source code with educational value and using idiomatic OCaml rather than trying to emulate Python semantics.
